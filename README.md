# CsDealer

## C# version of the PyDealer Python playing card library
### Built as a .NET Class Library using Visual Studio.

This library tends to use identical method names as Pydealer except when overriding a built-in C# method (e.g., str => ToString). Also uses C# naming conventions, so PascalCase for methods and camelCase for variables (no snake_case).

Documentation can be found [here](./Documentation/README.md).
