# CsDealer

## C# version of the PyDealer Python playing card library

A small amount of additional functionality was added, specifically in the Tools.GetList() method.
Documentation will be coming in the future, but, for now, the Python documentation can be used as a reference, seen here: https://pydealer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code.html

This library uses identical names (where possible) as Pydealer but with C# naming conventions, so PascalCase for methods and camelCase for variables (no underscores between words like in the PyDealer documentation).
