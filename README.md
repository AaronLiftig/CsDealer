# CsDealer

## C# version of the PyDealer Python playing card library

Documentation will be coming in the future, but for now the Python documentation can be used as a reference, seen here: https://pydealer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code.html

This library tends to use identical method names as Pydealer except when overriding a built-in C# method (e.g., str => ToString). Also uses C# naming conventions, so PascalCase for methods and camelCase for variables (no snake_case).
